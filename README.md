### Hi there 👋🤖💫



- 🔭 I completed my research on cybersecurity skills as a driver for economic growth in developing countries. I hope these countries find works valuable to advancing national capabilities. 

- $$$ I'm currently working on a 2nd phd - cybersecurity in financial institutions. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/financial-cybersecurity-assessing-critical-cost-fraser-casp-sscp/

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to conduct mixed methods research as I advance current research and work. 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on big data and cybersecurity analytics systems. 

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with developing AI models for anomaly and fraud detection. In addition, developing neural networks for occupation data.

- 💬 Ask me about analytics, cybersecurity, software engineering, programming, reverse engineering, or relevant topics. 

- 👋 Recently got a financial institution SOC 2 Type 2 for a complex trading platform in 30 days - using the three lined defense model and ITGC as lenses to test and remediate controls.
