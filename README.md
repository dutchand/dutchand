### Hi there 👋🤖💫



- 🔭 I completed my research on cybersecurity skills as a driver for economic growth in developing countries. I hope these countries find works valuable to advancing national capabilities. 

- $$$ I'm currently working on a 2nd pHd - cybersecurity in financial institutions. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to conduct mixed methods research as I advance current research and work. 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on big data and cybersecurity analytics systems. 

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with developing AI models for anomaly and fraud detection. In addition, developing neural networks for occupation data.
